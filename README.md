# fossjobs

[fossjobs.net](https://www.fossjobs.net/) is the first website exclusively for Free & Open Source jobs.

It uses the open source software [Jobberbase](http://www.jobberbase.com/).
See [their README.md](https://github.com/filipcte/jobberbase/blob/master/README.md) for links and installation guides.

You can [post a job on the website](https://www.fossjobs.net/post/), as long as it directly improves FOSS or open hardware projects. You can also submit jobs directly by emailing submit@fossjobs.net.
