# fossjobs

[fossjobs.net](https://www.fossjobs.net/) is the first website exclusively for Free & Open Source jobs.

It uses the open source software [Jobberbase](http://www.jobberbase.com/).
See [their README.md](https://github.com/filipcte/jobberbase/blob/master/README.md) for links and installation guides.

You can [post a job on the website](https://www.fossjobs.net/post/),
as long as it directly improves FOSS or open hardware projects.
You can also submit jobs directly by emailing <submit@fossjobs.net>.

In addition to the website, submitted jobs are also published in the following places:

- [RSS feeds](https://www.fossjobs.net/rss/)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@fossjobs)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fossjobs_net)
