version 1.7 (16/05/2009), tribute to putypuruty (http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/user19.html):
	* new: add/edit/delete cities from the admin section (see http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/post3500.html#p3500 for how to integrate this into an existing 1.6 version)
	* new: allow to post a job from the admin section (see http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/post4673.html#p4673 for how to integrate this into an existing 1.6 version)
	* new: in the admin section, for each job, show the number of views and if there are applicants, the number of applicants and the date of the last application (see http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/post4700.html#p4700 for how to integrate this into an existing 1.6 version)
	* fixed: get_cities() was called needlessly on every page (thus a database connection was made)
	* fixed: some users were getting 404 errors in the admin section because the top menu links did not end in a / char
	* fixed: in Internet Explorer, in the admin section, clicking on the create/edit page links was showing a blank page with a 'tinymce is undefined' JS error. This bug was reproducible only if opening the create/edit page in the same browser tab/page - opening it in a new browser tab/page worked.
	* enh: the number of minutes after which someone can apply again is now a constant defined in config.php
	* enh: the apply process now gives better error messages (if the number of minutes between applications did not pass, if the application mail could not be sent to the employer, if the apply form data was incorrect/incomplete) minor fixes and improvements

version 1.6 (28/12/2008), tribute to putypuruty (http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/user19.html):
	* added: i18n for labels inside javascript files
	* fixed: 'Invalid use of group function' exception in class.Stats.php
	* fixed: a database query exception was thrown if the search string contained a city that existed in the DB and ended in a space character (ie: "london "). This happened only for live-searches (via AJAX)
	* enh: GetJobsCountForAllCategs makes a single query now instead of a query for *each* category
	* fixed: made the select query compatible with mysql 4 in class.SpamReport.php
	* fixed: a database query exception was thrown if the words in the search query were separated by many whitespace characters (ie: "one    two    three")
	* fix/enh: tweaked the query that gets the job applications so that only applications which still point to a job are returned (in case you manually delete the jobs but don't remove the job applications)
	* enh: if the search query is empty, do nothing - until now (which was pretty confusing from end user point of view), all the jobs for the current category were displayed which could lead to huge results because if you're on the index page you will get *ALL* active jobs from the DB
	* fixed: allow to install jobberbase in a folder called "jobs" - thanks to links
	* fixed: the total number of applications/searches was not computed correctly; return meaningful data even if there are no applications/searches in class.Stats.php
	* enh: now, only one query is used to get the number of jobs per companies, instead of one query for *each* company
	* fixed: the number of jobs per company was wrong - it also included jobs that are not active
	* fixed: CheckPosterEmail was called needlessly when displaying jobs thus degrading performance (see http://www.jobberbase.com/forum/post2994.html)
	* fixed: although set, the job type (ie: full time, part time) was not remembered in the pagination process and thus the pagination was incorrect
	* fixed: a database query exception was thrown if more than one city was found from the search keywords
	* fixed: the URLs in the mail that is sent after a job is activated by the administrator are wrong
	* fixed: multiple emails were sent to the job poster if the jobberbase based site had google ads - thanks to links
	* fixed: moved stats in admin (/admin/stats/)
	* new: possibility to show cities in sidebar instead of categories (configurable from config.php)
	* new: SEO for Job Categories - thanks to CtCoder
	* new: spotlight jobs (sponsored jobs) - thanks to Chronos
	* new: 'Edit post' functionality in admin
